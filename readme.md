A set of AutoHotKey scripts I use daily on my Windows computers.

Generally written to avoid annoyances I find when using Windows.

## Features

* Modified version of FocuslessScroll, which allows you to scroll the window under the cursor and adds acceleration. This version has been modified to include "natural" (inverse) scrolling.
* Shortcut to minimise windows by scrolling on their titlebar
* Mac-like hotkeys for various common functions like sleeping the display, shutting down, rebooting
* Media and volume keys modeled after Apple's keyboard layouts
* Accidental presses of Caps Lock are ignored - you need to press it for at least 100ms to register (most accidental presses are quicker than that)
* Clipboard monitor which rewrites afp protocol links as Windows-friendly SMB paths (Note: Is not aware of context. Simply translates host and path name)
* Pauses iTunes playback (if running and playing) on session lock
* iTunes metadata support (Incomplete at this stage)
* Volume meter (showing the first 20% of the volume scale) compatible with Windows Vista and Windows 7. Disabled on Windows 8 in favour of Windows' new built-in volume meter
* Relatively convenient Scroll Lock toggle for most key overrides (but not all hotkeys) so it doesn't interrupt anything
* A handful of basic hotstrings (still playing with this for now)

## Requirements

* Windows Vista, 7 or 8 (Note that Vista is not tested)
* A Unicode version of Autohotkey_L (Current versions of Autohotkey seem to all "just work" but YMMV)
* The [Vista Audio Control library](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/21984-vista-audio-control-functions/)

## Setup

* Make sure Autohotkey is installed
* Unzip or checkout this code to a directory of your choosing (somewhere in Documents is probably a good idea)
* (Optional) Disable components (see "config.ini" section below)
* (Optional) Put a `volume.wav` file in the same directory to play a short sound when changing volume (Extracting and converting `volume.aiff` from an OS X system works nicely - not provided for obvious legal reasons)
* Create a shortcut in your Startup folder running AutoHotKey for each script you want to run
* Run your shortcuts (they won't run automatically until you log back in)

## `config.ini`

The `config.ini` file, stored in the same directory as the script itself.

### General

* `clipboard` - Enable clipboard monitoring and replacement (`true` or `false`)
* `itunes` - Enable iTunes-specific functionality (`true` or `false`)

### Hotkeys

* `macstyle` - Enable Mac-style keyboard shortcuts ("System, Session and Hardware" section below) (`true` or `false`)
* `itunes` - Enable iTunes integration for computer lock pause function (`true` or `false`)
* `everything` - Enable "Everything" search integration. (`true` or `false`)
* `mediakeys` - Enable media playback keys ("Media Playback" section below) (`true` or `false`)
* `volumekeys` - Enable system volume control keys ("System Volume" section below) (`true` or `false`)

### OSD

* `enable` - Show volume OSD (Always overridden to "false" on Windows 8) (`true` or `false`)

### FocuslessScroll

* `linespernotchmin` - Minimum lines-per-notch value (Controls scroll wheel acceleration) (Number)
* `linespernotchmax` - Maximum lines-per-notch value (Number)
* `accelerationthreshold` - Maximum acceleration for scroll wheel (Number)
* `accelerationtype` - Acceleration algorithm. Either Linear, or Parabolic (`L` or `P`)
* `stutterthreshold` - Threshold for stuttering. Prevents stutter caused by cheap mice. Minimum delay between scroll inputs in milliseconds (Number)
* `naturalscrolling` - Use Natural scrolling (like on touch devices, and modern versions of Mac OS X) (`true` or `false`)
* `emulatestandardwithscrolllock` - Disable enhancements when Scroll Lock is enabled (`true` or `false`)

## Key Mappings

* `Scroll Lock`: Enable/Disable hoykeys, natural scrolling and acceleration

NOTE: Shortcuts marked with an asterisk are _not_ disabled by `Scroll Lock`. Hotkeys disabled within `config.ini` are not toggled by `Scroll Lock`. The following can be overriden in the `Keymap` section of `config.ini` to use another key.

### Media Playback

* `F6`: Media key Rewind/Previous (`mediaprev` in `config.ini`)
* `F7`: Media key Play/Pause (`mediaplay` in `config.ini`)
* `F8`: Media key Fast Forward/Next (`medianext` in `config.ini`)

### System Volume

* `F9`: Mute/Unmute (`volumemute` in `config.ini`)
* `F10`: Volume Down (`volumedown` in `config.ini`)
* `F11`: Volume Up (`volumeup` in `config.ini`)

### System, Session and Hardware

* `Alt`+`Backspace`: Delete to last space*
* `Control`+`Shift`+`F12`, `Win`+`L`: Sleep display and lock session* (`lock` in `config.ini`)
* `Control`+`Win`+`Alt`+`F12`: Shut Down*
* `Control`+`Alt`+`F12`: Restart*
* `F12`: Eject DVD Drive (`eject` in `config.ini`)
* `Win`+`Space`, `Control`+`f`: Search using Everything*

### iTunes Metadata

* `Control`+`Win`+`↑`: Increase rating of current iTunes track by half a star* (`itunesrateup` in `config.ini`)
* `Control`+`Win`+`↓`: Decrease rating of current iTunes track by half a star* (`itunesratedown` in `config.ini`)
